# Three.js Solar System

### Description

I am currently learning Three.js with the help of [three.js-journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). I use this repo
to practice the theory that I've learned. My goal is to update this project every time I have learned something new (
if it can be applied to this demo). For the moment I am using plain three.js with TypeScript. In a later stage, I'll
refactor the application to React Three Fiber.

### Roadmap

This is a very rudimentary roadmap of what I try to accomplish and might change over time.

- [x] Create a scene
- [x] Create planets
- [x] Make the planets orbit the sun
- [ ] Make the sun glow
- [ ] Add light to and shadow (sun should lighten up surrounding planets)
- [ ] Use a better scale for orbit speed and planet sizes
- [ ] Add missing planets
- [ ] Draw the orbit of planets with lines on the scene
- [ ] Add modals that display extra information about a planet (R3F)
- [ ] Adjust zooming so that it's blocked from a certain level of zoom in/out
- [ ] Add loading screen
