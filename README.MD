# Three.js Solar System

### Description

I am currently learning Three.js with the help of [three.js-journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). I use this repo
to practice theory that I've learned. The goal is to keep updating this demo project each time I've discovered new
things which
are relevant to my solar system demo. For the moment I am using plain three.js with TypeScript. In a later stage, I'll
refactor the application
to React Three Fiber.

### Roadmap

This is a very rudimentary roadmap I will try to accomplish.

- [x] Create a scene
- [x] Create planets
- [x] Make the planets orbit the sun
- [x] Make the sun glow
- [ ] Add light to and shadow (sun should lighten up surrounding planets)
- [ ] Use a better scale for orbit speed and planet sizes
- [ ] Add missing planets
- [ ] Draw the orbit of planets with lines on the scene
- [ ] Add modals that display extra information about a planet (R3F)
- [ ] Adjust zooming so that it's blocked from a certain level of zoom in/out
